# What is Content?
- In Drupal, each item of content is called a Node.
- And Each content belongs to a single content type.

# What is Content Type?
- A Content Type is a pre-defined collection of data types (Fields) using which we can add content to our Drupal site.
- By default, there are two content types created on fresh Drupal Installation.
     - Article
     - Basic Page
- We can also create our own content types or modify the default content types based on our requirements.
- Each time you create a post (content), a content type is being used to hold and form the items you enter.
- When you save the post, you have created a node using a content type.
